Hi guys !

I will show you how to integrate email module in your program.
Email module class is very simple, because I don't have your BD class, source code and DB so cannot build some necessary features.
- Read email list from database. (data table for temporary email list |email address|subject|body|)
- Store email to database.
- Check internet. 
- Integrate to your UI. (cannot find your UI, source code or anything)
..
See you later, I will complete my work soon.
